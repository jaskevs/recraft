# Repository Guidelines

The complete contributor guide now lives in `README.md`. Start there for:
- Project structure, build commands, and schema workflows (`README.md` -> Project Structure & Module Organization, Development Commands).
- Coding standards, testing expectations, and contribution checklists (`README.md` -> Coding Style & Naming Conventions, Testing & QA, Contribution Guidelines).
- Environment variables, Directus schema snapshots, and supporting docs (`README.md` -> Environment & Configuration, Documentation).

Update `README.md` whenever the process changes so this repository keeps a single source of truth.
